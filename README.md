# LogiMouse
A small program for Windows that allows the user to control their mouse pointer with a joystick.

This program is designed to run only on Windows. It relies on the Windows joystick API to function.

I wrote this program a long time ago after both my USB mouse and integrated touchpad stopped working. I hope someone else can use it like I did.
